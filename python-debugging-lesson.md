# CodeSensei Output: Socratic Debugging Session

**Simulated User Input:** Python code with a RecursionError bug in a factorial function.

**Tutor Session Summary (3 Points)**

1.  **Concept Mastery:** The session focused on understanding **recursion base cases**. The Socratic method successfully guided the user to identify that without a defined stopping point, the function calls itself infinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.
2.  **Debugging Strategy:** The user learned to use print statements strategically to trace the flow of execution and confirm the exact point where the function failed to exit the loop.
3.  **Long-Term Retention:** The user successfully fixed the bug independently, validating the Socratic approach over simply providing the corrected code.

## Post-Lesson Quiz (Tests for Retention)

**1. What is the fundamental purpose of a base case in a recursive function?**
   A. To optimize memory usage.
   B. To prevent the function from running infinitely. (Correct)
   C. To define the function's return type.
   D. To pass arguments to the next call.

**2. Which Python error is most commonly associated with a missing base case?**
   A. ValueError
   B. SyntaxError
   C. RecursionError (Correct)
   D. TypeError

**3. If a recursive function runs correctly but returns an incorrect value, what type of flaw is most likely present?**
   A. Logic Flaw (Correct)
   B. Syntax Error
   C. Base Case Error
   D. Import Error
